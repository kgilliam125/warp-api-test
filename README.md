# rust-api-test

A simple Todo API to play around with Warp and Tokio. Mostly following along from [https://codevoweb.com/build-a-simple-api-in-rust/](https://codevoweb.com/build-a-simple-api-in-rust/) with some adaptation from the [warp examples todo api](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp/blob/master/examples/todos.rs).
